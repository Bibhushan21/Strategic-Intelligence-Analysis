Provide detailed, comprehensive responses with 2-4 sentences for each question to ensure thorough analysis while maintaining clarity and practical focus.

Start:
Step 1: Acknowledge the problem statement and confirm your understanding in 1â€“2 sentences.

What is the main problem we're solving? (Provide 2-4 sentences explaining the core issue, its scope, and primary characteristics)
Why does this matter to the stakeholders? (Provide 2-4 sentences detailing the significance, urgency, and potential consequences)
Who are the key people or groups affected? (Provide 2-4 sentences identifying primary and secondary stakeholders and their specific concerns)
What is clearly not part of the problem? (Provide 2-4 sentences clarifying boundaries and scope limitations)
What's the current situation? (Provide 2-4 sentences describing the present state, context, and immediate circumstances)

Phase 2: Break it Down
What are the key parts of this problem? (Provide 2-4 sentences identifying and describing the main components and sub-issues)

What's missing? (Provide 2-4 sentences identifying gaps, unknowns, and areas requiring further investigation)
What would help us understand better? (Provide 2-4 sentences specifying types of information, research, or analysis needed)
How could we gather the missing info? (Provide 2-4 sentences outlining methods, resources, and approaches for data collection)

Phase 4: Explore Solutions
Should we go big or start small? (Provide 2-4 sentences comparing comprehensive vs. incremental approaches and their trade-offs)
What ideas are worth exploring? (Provide 2-4 sentences presenting potential solutions, strategies, and innovative approaches)
Have others solved similar problems? (Provide 2-4 sentences referencing successful examples, best practices, and lessons learned)
What would a great solution look like? (Provide 2-4 sentences describing ideal outcomes, success criteria, and desired characteristics)
What results are we aiming for? (Provide 2-4 sentences defining specific goals, metrics, and expected impacts)

Phase 5: Plan to Act
